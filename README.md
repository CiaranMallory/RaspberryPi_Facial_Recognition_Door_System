# RaspberryPi_Facial_Recognition_Door_System
The goal of this project was to design a RaspberryPi controlled door system that would open and close a door using a servo motor when a face known to the model was detected via a webcam connected to the RaspberryPi. 
The model used for this project was trained using Pythons face_recognition module.
